"""Compaction and handoffs: Jev decides what survives, a text model only writes it up.

Jev cannot summarize. What it can do, in one fast request, is read a transcript
turn by turn and mark each turn as something to carry forward word for word, to
fold into the summary, or to drop. The summarizing model then gets a fraction of
the transcript with the decisions, open work and pointers already pulled out, so
the handoff is shorter, cheaper, and stops losing the one line that mattered.

Use exactly these five headings, in this order, nothing before or after:
## Working on
## State
## Decisions
## Pointers
## Next

Rules:
- Under 400 words total.
- Every line marked [KEEP VERBATIM] carries a decision, a constraint, an exact value, a path,
  an id, a command or an error. Carry those through UNCHANGED. Do not paraphrase them.
- [background] lines only need their gist, at most a sentence or two of context.
- Pointers means exact paths, ids, URLs, ports, branch names, commands. No prose there.
- Next means what the following session should actually do first, concretely.
- Write nothing you cannot support from the transcript below. No guessing, no filler,
  no "the user seems to want". If something is unknown, say it is unknown.
- Plain sentences. No bullets inside a section unless listing pointers.
"""


CONFIDENTIAL_RULES = """
CONFIDENTIALITY — these override the rules above wherever they conflict:
- This handoff is a BREADCRUMB, not a summary. Record only: the task, which classes of
  source were checked, what evidence is still missing, who owns or must approve it, and
  the next safe action.
- Never carry a person's name, an email address, a phone number, a street address, a
  document or file name, a message id, a link, an account or invoice number, or any
  payment, health or disability detail. Write "the customer", "the staff member", "the
  quote in the shared drive" instead.
- A business location IS an operational fact, not personal data. Keep a site, branch,
  city or depot by name when the work depends on it — "ship to Fort Walton, not Destin"
  must survive verbatim. Dropping it to "the approved location" destroys the only thing
  that sentence was for. The line is: a place a business operates from, yes; a place a
  person lives, no.
- This REPLACES the instruction to keep identifiers verbatim. Where a [KEEP VERBATIM]
  line contains an identifier of that kind, carry the decision it expresses and drop the
  identifier. "Call Jane Doe on 555-0134 before Tuesday" becomes "call the customer back
  before Tuesday" — the deadline survives, the person does not.
- Internal technical pointers — file paths on our own servers, branch names, commands,
  ports, error strings — are fine and should be kept.
- If following these rules would leave a section with nothing to say, write "nothing
  recorded" under it rather than reaching for detail you are not allowed to keep.
