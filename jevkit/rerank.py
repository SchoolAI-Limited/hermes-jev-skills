"""Memory and retrieval: decide which already-retrieved passages deserve context.

Your memory store stays the source of truth. After it returns a shortlist, Jev
scores every passage for relevance and for hidden instructions, so the agent reads
five good passages instead of forty mixed ones. A local, no-network screen runs on
every passage as well, on every path, so an outage degrades to pattern-only
screening rather than to none, and the result always says which of the two it got.
