"""Pick the cheapest model that is good enough for this turn.

Jev answers three things in one request: how hard the turn is, what kind of work
it is, and whether a mistake would be costly. Code, not Jev, turns that into a
model: it walks the pool for that tier and specialty and takes the first model
that fits the turn's hard requirements (images, context size). Every unsure or
